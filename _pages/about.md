# Objective
I am a research analyst with the City College of San Francisco, working to improve the California community college experience with data-driven solutions. I come from a background of epidemiological statistics and ecological modeling. I am a creative problem solver, an artist, and a climber.

# Current Position

Administrative Analyst - [Office of Research and Planning at the City College of San Francisco](https://www.ccsf.edu/about-ccsf/administration/academic-institutional-affairs/institutional-advancement-and-effectiveness/office-research-planning)

# Education

# Experience

### Administrative Analyst, 02/2023 - present, City College of San Francisco, San Francisco, CA
* Assess patterns in enrollment, equity, and learning outcomes to promote instiutional effectiveness
* Use SQL queries to retrieve information for easily-interpretable reports and data visualizations for faculty members and administrators to reference

### Graduate Student Researcher, 09/2020 – 09/2022, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA
*	Estimated Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) of COVID-19 in early 2020 from publicly available case and death data, resulting in the first IFR estimate for a United States population
* Inferred undiagnosed infections using a Bayesian framework, while still accounting for age differences and variances in incubation and reporting delay distributions
*	Compared global fatality rates to identify root causes for international differences in mortality outcomes, and found that income inequality is a major driving factor for mortality outcomes for people aged 40-60
*	1st author on resulting publication; in review, with a preprint available at: https://bit.ly/3abTiVg 

### Postbac Student Researcher, 11/2019–08/2020, Stanford University, Stanford, CA
* Aggregated qualitative data on the lifespans and environmental persistence of 150 parasites and pathogens; found that diseases with environmental components are more difficult to control and eradicate
* Published findings available at: [https://bit.ly/3c30owl](https://bit.ly/3c30owl) 

### Undergraduate Student Researcher, 06/2015 – 06/2018, Stanford University, Stanford, CA
* Constructed a stochastic model of the population genetics of the freshwater snail responsible for transmitting schistosomiasis, a Neglected Tropical Disease and a disease of poverty 
* Projected theoretical changes to local disease burden after introducing a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene drive designed to confer resistance to the snail hosts
* Findings in review, with a preprint available at: [https://bit.ly/3Mxg4oa](https://bit.ly/3Mxg4oa) 

### Teaching Assistant, 09/2020 – 08/2022, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA
* BIOE 109: Evolution, Fall 2020
* BIOE 107: Ecology, Spring 2021
* COSMOS: Entomology, Summer 2022

### Podcast Producer, 09/2021 - 10/2022, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA
* Interviewed local biologists and conservationists for the [Santa Cruz Naturalist](https://open.spotify.com/show/22DGQdylvM6tGIsswFVGS2?si=496c657d036741cf) podcast
* Mixed and edited podcast content to air on a local radio station for a general audience

### MINT Program Mentor, 09/2021-06/2022, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA
* Mentored undergraduate students in the process of applying to graduate schools
* Provided undergraduate students with opportunities to gain lab and field experience
