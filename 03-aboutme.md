I love a good puzzle, and that's why I split my time between data science and artistic endeavors. I'm most interested in puzzles with a biological and/or social base. I also feel that it's crucial to effectively communicate those ideas through art. I currently work as a contracted data analyst for the RP Group and take artistic commissions. I am also a board member for the Santa Cruz Children's Museum of Discovery and I love getting incolved in local museum and art initiatives.

As an Air Force dependent, I grew up over 9 different military installations across the United States. For the past 11 years, I've called Northern California my home. I attended Stanford University (B.S. Bioengineering, 2018) and the University of California Santa Cruz (M.S. Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, 2022). I am currently based in Santa Cruz, CA but I love to spend time rock climbing in the Sierra Nevadas.
